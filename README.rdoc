= watir-performance
Predecessor to https://github.com/90kts/watir-webdriver-performance for Watir as opposed to watir-webdriver

The Watir-Performance aims to provide a set of navigation timing metrics for Watir actions using a {W3C page performance standard}[http://w3c-test.org/webperf/specs/NavigationTiming/]. This is a perfect solution to capture response time metrics, and itâ€™s very straightforward to do.  Works for Chrome, Firefox, Edge and IE9 and up. Currently no Safari support.

This gem collects and summarises metrics speficied in the W3C Navigation
web performance specifications at
https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webperf/raw-file/tip/specs/NavigationTiming/Overview.html when using
watir and a compatible browser.

== Example output of browser.performance
All summary times are in milliseconds, and are an abstraction of the w3c
web performance specification.

== Contributing to watir-performance

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
